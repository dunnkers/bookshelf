# bookshelf
Hi! This is my bookshelf. It uses a [backend](https://github.com/dunnkers/goodreads-api) that pulls publicly available information from [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com/).

![bookshelf example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/744430/80863557-93ff3c80-8c7d-11ea-9453-0c832e96842d.png)

^ example of the bookshelf.

## Usage

1. Install deps:

    ```
    yarn
    ```

2. Build the website:

    ```
    yarn build
    ```

    This now put a static website in `build`. You can deploy this to GitHub pages.
